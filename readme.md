## A Visual Laravel Tutorial 
Many times I find myself building something for a class; however, with my bad memory and a lapse of time, I forget those things I don't work with everyday.
Hopefully, I plan to make this a very basic framework to hold animated visual instructions to guide me through the process and quickly get up to speed.

## Why was this built?
This Laravel Project was created for a class requirement to demonstrate a solid understanding of using PHP and Laravel in a basic Web Application.

## Database Operations included
This application demonstrates four key database operations: Create, Update, Delete, and Retrieve. 

## Basic Functionality
The basic functionality is made of a basic media table that holds a list of videos that can be selected and played.
There is no need for authenticating users; however, there is one privileged account to select, edit, and upload video files for deployment.
A second table is implemented so that recommendations can be collected and viewed in a central area.
